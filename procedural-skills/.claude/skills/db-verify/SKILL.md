# Verify Database

Check that the database directory and index file exist and are properly structured.

Use TaskCreate to create a task for each step below, then execute them in order. Mark each task `in_progress` when starting and `completed` when done using TaskUpdate.

## Step 1: Check Database Directory

Use the Bash tool to check if the `database/` directory exists:

```bash
[ -d "database" ] && echo "EXISTS" || echo "MISSING"
```

If the output is "MISSING":
- Report to the caller: "Database not initialized. Use the `db-init` skill to create it."
- STOP execution. Do not proceed to further steps.

## Step 2: Check Index File

Use the Read tool to read `database/index.md`.

If the file does not exist or returns an error:
- Report to the caller: "Database index is missing. Use the `db-init` skill to reinitialize."
- STOP execution. Do not proceed to further steps.

## Step 3: Validate Index Structure

Verify the index file contains the expected structure:
- Should have a `# Database Index` heading
- Should have a `## Documents` section

If the structure is malformed:
- Report to the caller: "Database index is malformed. Consider reinitializing with `db-init`."
- STOP execution.

## Step 4: Report Success

If all checks pass, report to the caller: "Database verified and ready."
