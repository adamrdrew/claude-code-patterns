# Synthesize Dialectic Positions

Combine thesis (Advocate) and antithesis (Critic) into synthesis (conclusion).

Use TaskCreate to create a task for each step below, then execute them in order. Mark each task `in_progress` when starting and `completed` when done using TaskUpdate.

## Step 1: Review Both Positions

Confirm you have:
- The Advocate's case (thesis)
- The Critic's case (antithesis)

If either is missing, note what's needed before synthesis can proceed.

## Step 2: Extract Key Arguments

From the Advocate, list:
1. Primary benefits claimed
2. Evidence or reasoning provided
3. How they addressed objections

From the Critic, list:
1. Primary risks identified
2. Evidence or reasoning provided
3. Alternatives suggested

## Step 3: Find Agreement

Identify where both positions actually align:
- Shared assumptions
- Agreed-upon facts
- Common values or goals

This is often more substantial than it first appears.

## Step 4: Map Genuine Tensions

Identify true tradeoffs that can't be eliminated:
- Where benefits come with inherent costs
- Where one value conflicts with another
- Where uncertainty prevents resolution

For each tension, note:
- What choosing one side sacrifices
- Whether the tension can be mitigated

## Step 5: Evaluate Argument Strength

For each major point from both sides:

| Argument | Source | Evidence | Weight |
|----------|--------|----------|--------|
| [claim] | Advocate/Critic | Strong/Weak/None | High/Medium/Low |

Weight based on:
- Quality of evidence
- Relevance to core question
- Probability of claimed outcome

## Step 6: Find the Synthesis

The synthesis is NOT:
- The average of both positions
- A compromise that pleases neither
- Just picking a winner

The synthesis IS:
- A deeper understanding that emerges from the tension
- Recognition of what each side got right
- A path forward that addresses the strongest concerns

Ask: "What would someone who fully understood both positions conclude?"

## Step 7: Make a Recommendation

After synthesis, provide a clear recommendation:

**Proceed** if:
- Benefits outweigh risks
- Critical concerns are addressable
- No fatal flaws identified

**Don't proceed** if:
- Risks outweigh benefits
- Critical concerns are fundamental
- Better alternatives exist

**Investigate further** if:
- Cannot decide without specific information
- Key assumptions are untested
- Stakes warrant more analysis

## Step 8: Document Conditions

If recommending to proceed:
- What concerns must be addressed?
- What should be monitored?
- What would cause reconsideration?

If recommending against:
- What alternatives should be explored?
- What would change the analysis?

## Step 9: Present Synthesis

Report the full synthesis using the Arbiter's output structure.
